## Roadmap for development : IBEEM Computational Workflow Guide

This documents big picture changes, direction, concepts and content ideas for the dynamic book written for the 
[MSU IBEEM](https://ibeem.msu.edu) project.   Collaborators add any ideas and new sections as needed.  Ultimately will include timeline for when these will be implemented.   From this document, github issues will be created to drive development in this project in the [main github project](https://github.com/IBEEM-MSU/ibeem-devguide/issues)

## Timeline

December 2024 : Guidelines and roadmap established (Bills, Kapsar, Zarnetske)

  - How to effectively use github issues
  - Practical examples of commits (both scope of content committed and commit messages) in GitHub, including
