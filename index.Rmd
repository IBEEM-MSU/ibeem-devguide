# Introduction

This guide is for current practitioners and programmers of computational biodiversity, ecology, evolution, and macrosystems 
science/research who want to improve the way they create and share their code. 

This is focused on, but not limited to the R System for Statistics. 

Each chapter covers a technique borrowed from software engineering that could be applied to your code, with motivation for why you'd need it, what problem is being solved, the outcome and alternatives (if any). 

*This is in early stages of development*
